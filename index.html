        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is varied, and has been present for most of my life! From a very young age, I've had access
          to technology such as computers, televisions, gaming consoles and the likes. Pointing to a specific point in
          my life which seriously peaked my interest in IT, was on my 12th birthday, when I received a hand me down
          iphone. Some of the specific interests I have in IT are: video games, web-development, PC building and
          keyboard building; all of which I also have extensive experience in.
        </p>
        <p>
          My university career path has been an interesting one. Initially, after completing highschool i studied for a
          Bachelor of Science at Melbourne University. After a year of studies there, I was under the impression that it
          was too broad of a university course for me, and shifted to Deakin University studying a Bachelor of
          Biomedical Science. At this point, I continued the course for two and a half years, hoping to see and
          experience a subject, an event or anything at all, that would finally reveal and show my interest in the
          field, however it never arised. As such, I took the plunge and partook in a 6 month coding bootcamp, and from
          then onwards I never looked back! I developed my own project management app, linked to github commits, and
          used this project to apply for jobs all over Melbourne; and was fortunate enough to land a full-time web
          developer role, which I am currently working at. As for why I decided to come to RMIT, was the ability for me
          to study completely online at my own pace, along with RMIT being a well respected university when it comes to
          the Information Technology field.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main things I hope to achieve during my studies here, is a broader and better understanding of
          concepts which I either have self taught myself, or only received a very brief introduction to during my
          coding bootcamp. Such concepts such as: Sorting Algorithms, programing styles (i.e OOP), networking skills and
          the likes.

          I am interested in IT from my childhood. My uncle was a computer programmer, I read one of his book and other
          books about computers
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I got some experience in mainframe programming when I was studying in university. As first personal computers
          became available, I bought one of them. It could be programmed in Assembler and Basic and did some
          programming. But western personal computers were not affordable in USSR and Russia and my career went to
          Mechanical Engineering. When difficulties started to find a job for Mechanical Engineer, I had got a degree in
          area of IT and worked as a system administrator for UNIX systems and help IT officer in one company in Russia.
          After my migration to Australia, I worked as proprietary software developer and help IT officer here. The
          course Bachelor of IT in RMIT is suitable for me by its syllabus and because it has four study periods per
          year, this allows to distribute studying load more evenly. RMIT has a pretty high rank among Australian
          universities

          Most of my spare time is spent playing video games, mostly single player games. Favourite games pretty much
          come from three franchises; Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda. Once in a blue moon I’ll
          try out an MMO, but I get way too invested and spend every other moment playing until I get to a point a
          couple of months later and realise I just need to stop. Most notably with FFXIV, which every couple of years
          I’ll pick up again.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT began at a fairly young age. Playing around with the family computer when I was probably
          about 9 years old, fascinated by the internet, the amazing graphics of the old 8-bit DOS games, and just
          exploring though all the systems, settings and files that every computer has.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          While I have no formal training in IT, I have taught myself a decent amount (mostly through Google). When I
          was younger my father collected used computers and I had the time of my life pulling them apart and playing
          around with the hardware. (I was always better at pulling them apart than I was at putting them back
          together). At work I’m the one anyone goes to with any IT issues before contacting our actual IT department.
          As I have been with the company for so long I’ve learned quite a bit about how our systems work and what the
          most common fixes are. And if I don’t know I’ll generally tinker around until I get it, with a pretty good
          success rate!

        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is constantly expanding. Every day I find a new area of IT that I’d love to explore. An area
          I’m passionate about is computer hardware and software building/troubleshooting. I enjoy building computer
          systems, but I also really enjoy digging into software and hardware to find & resolve any issues. I think my
          IT interest started at a young age when my mother introduced me to video games, she had a PS1 and she showed
          me games like Crash Bandicoot and Sonic. Later, I got a DS and I played games like The Legend of Zelda. Since
          then, I’ve been in love with video games and all the technology that comes with it.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I’m not sure if there was a particular event that caused my interest in IT, but it was definitely my mother
          who introduced me to all different types of technology. Since a young age, I’ve had access to iPods, Smart
          phones, Tablets, laptops and more. Because I’ve had access to these platforms for so long, I’ve been learning
          about all the different operating systems and how each device/environment works.

          I enjoy gaming on pretty much every platform from PS5 to PCs. I really enjoy building PCs as I have built two

          recently.) I also enjoy going out and drinking at bars and catching up with Uni friends and school friends

        <h3>IT Interest</h3>
        <p>
          My interest in IT is mainly due to my fascination with tech and mostly new and upcoming tech. Ever since I was
          a child, I had obsessed over pretty much anything electronic I could get my hands on. From my father’s first
          COMPAQ desktop computer to the old Nokia flip phones.
        </p>
        <h3>IT Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I don’t have any professional experience with IT. My only experience is from watching YouTube videos from
          popular tech creators such as Linus Tech Tips. I hope to gain valuable knowledge from RMIT and hopefully
          graduate with a Bachelor of IT. I specifically chose RMIT to study at because they offer a fully online
          Degree. This is especially important to me as I currently work 4-5 days a week already and would find
          travelling to Uni very difficult.

      <h2>Project Description </h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>We wish to create a cleaning and chore scheduling app. This will assist users in organizing a functional cleaning and chore checklist. A household will be created with a number and name of rooms as specified by the user. Tasks may then be assigned to rooms throughout the house as both one-off assignments and recurring tasks. Lists of tasks as well as households and rooms will be stored on a database to allow access to the list from multiple devices. The program will also keep track of all completed tasks each week. This information may be used to create a progress report or relay to the user the work they have/ have not completed.  
        </p>
        <p> 
          Users will be able to join a household by themselves or cooperatively with other users, logging in securely with a created username and password. If in a household with multiple users, the room layout and task list will be shared. This will keep track of which users complete what tasks and update the database as any changes are made. Tasks may also be assigned to specific users if desired allowing multiple user households to know who is responsible for each task. Users will be able to see if a certain member is not completing their required tasks or if an individual is regularly doing more work than others and adjust their routines accordingly.
         </p>
         <p>
          For someone who works full time and studies part time, it is difficult to set up a cleaning structure at home. It’s very easy to just get home and do nothing. Something like this, sending reminders out to do specific things every now and then could hopefully be the little push needed to help motivate one to perform cleaning duties throughout the week. Also, it helps not to just forget about household duties behind other important businesses and avoid chaos when a number of people choose the same duties to do. 
         </p>
         <p>
          Some software to help to organize family duties already exist on the market. These programs will make easy the planning of purchases, family events. Also they help to allocate household tasks, and more functionality. The best such applications, according (Wondershare, 2022), are Cozi Family Organizer (https://www.cozi.com), Our Home (http://www.ourhomeapp.com), Picniic (https://www.picniic.com), Hub Family Organizer (https://www.hubapp.com), and so on. But these applications are developed for parents with children and for smart phones. This project is intended for use also by adult family members, be portable and be used from both smart phones and tablets and PCs platforms.

         </p>

        <h3>Aims</h3>
        <p>
          Our Aim is to create a household chore scheduling app for households with multiple occupants. We believe that younger people living in places like share homes are often inexperienced in maintaining a clean household. A tool for them to see what tasks need doing and who is doing it would be extremely valuable. With share houses in mind, we will emphasize both functionality and simplicity in our design. We want our product to be as widely accessible as possible so that households with mixed or lower levels of technical ability can all use our product.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing a good user interface is key in creating an app that seeks to promote productivity therefore, from the perspective of the user the app should have the following functionality. When the app is initially opened the user should be able to select a name for themselves. Following this they should be presented with the option of either joining an existing household or creating a new one. If a household is being created the number and name of rooms must be included as well. The user should not have to enter any of this information on subsequent uses of the app. On recurring visits, the user should be able to see current jobs and check them, add additional jobs or modify existing ones. If the app is tedious to use it will be ignored and therefore pointless. This is the core functionality of our app and crucial to its creation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to facilitate the functionality of our app some sort of database will need to be created. User names, households, lists of rooms as well as the jobs on the list itself must all be stored somewhere. This will need to be in some form of cloud storage or otherwise hosted server as we want each user to be able to access and edit the list independently. This should also be relatively secure as while it is not crucial information potential names, living arrangements and house sizes may be valuable to someone. This is also a fundamental building block of our program and must be completed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our app should also be functional on multiple operating systems, specifically Android and IOS. This is important as members of a household often do not share the same OS and without the entire household having access our app loses significant value. As these platforms use different architecture our program will likely have to be developed separately on each. However, using an external database means we should not lose functionality. One platform could be prioritized if forced but this would drastically cut down potential users to only households using entirely the selected platform.  
          Additional features could be added to improve the quality of the app. These are not needed for core functionality so should not be prioritized but definitely considered during the development process to make their implementation quicker in the future. This would include things such as options for application to send notifications to the user if requested. Additionally, it would also show weekly summary statistics such as what members of the household completed the most tasks, or if someone was the only member to complete a certain task over a given time frame. 
        </p>

        <h3>Roles</h3>
        <p>
          For the most part our group did not have any defined roles. We are all relatively inexperienced and do not necessarily have specific skills that would benefit from being utilized in a specific role. Keeping a looser framework allows us to be more flexible in allocation of work. There is however one major exception to this in Suva. Their employment as a full-stack web-developer and general familiarity with programming was a valuable asset to this group and they have assumed the role of lead developer. The rest of the group endeavours to facilitate this and support the lead developer. Some smaller roles such as keeping notes of each meeting or managing the tools the group uses to work together are part of our group structure. However not every meeting requires the attendance of every member, so these positions remain flexible.

        <h3> Scope, Tools and Plans and Progress </h3>
        <p>
          Tasker is a home management software, which has functions which can extend towards other aspects of management, such as general day to day tasks. It started as a general idea, owing to many of our Developers and employees needing better structure in their day-to-day life at home: whether this be something as simple as holding themselves accountable to doing daily cleaning, or setting more specific goals in their daily life. This was the origin of Tasker. During development, Tasker had multiple names. It was initially conceived as: Organized Home, however owing to an expansion of scope to include other features that may extend outside of the home, it was renamed to Tasker.
        </p>
        <p> Tasker has made significant progression towards a minimum viable product, however there are still many features that would need to be implemented for it to get to this stage. In getting to this stage of development, significant decisions as well as a restructure, was made to the initial setup. </p>

        <p> Initially, to create an MVP, the project was conceived as a static HTML CSS and JS page, and it was all going to be created as such. However, a while into development it became clear that, owing to how dynamic the project must be, as well as the introduction of user authentication within the scope of the MVP, the project needed to be restructured in such a way, that allowed for a lot of dynamic content to be rendered. After some amount of research, the obvious choice for this was React. </p>

        <p>React is a JavaScript front-end library, that was made by Facebook, to deliver a highly dynamic, highly performant, and highly optimized framework for web application. As such, it was a perfect fit for Tasker. Learning react was a bit of a challenge as it takes a different approach to state management with the use of its 'React Hooks'. However, whilst the learning curve was steep, after a baseline knowledge was achieved, management of dynamic structure and the ease of rendering dynamic content became unparalleled.  </p>
        
        <p>React Hooks, allow the software to be incredibly performant, owing to it only rending, refreshing, and building information and data that is necessary. Using the built in react hooks, such as: useState, useEffect and useRef, we can call for updates to the page in a performant way. If these hooks are never called, then the output is not reflected on the page. Additional, further hooks can be imported in via modules. One such module used in the project is GraphQL which gives access to the useQuery and useMutation hooks. Essentially, these two hooks allow us to use the data queried from the database, in a resource efficient manner. </p>

        <p> The main concept which allows react to dynamically render the content it needs, is its component-based structure. When you create a component, such as for example a navigation bar, in a traditional static structure, on every new page, the entire code as well as it's dependencies will need to be imported into the page. This is generally not an issue when only a few static pages are built, that are not dynamic to the people visiting the page; however, when the content on the page changes dependant on the users visiting the sites, it becomes an impossible task. With react, you can build a "Nav" component, which contains all data, and dependencies it needs within itself, and can easily and effortlessly be imported into another page by using a top-level import, following by calling the component itself. For dynamic content, properties can be passed into the component.</p>

        <p>This would render the baseline styling of the card, whilst also including a name of Suva and a state of In Progress onto the card, based on where the dynamic content of the card is placed within the component, usually denoted by, for example: props.user or props.state; </p>

        <p>In relation to dynamic content, the storing of data was also a source of contention when trying to land on an MVP. Initially, when the decision was to use static HTML CSS and JS, data would have been stored using the local storage capabilities of the browser, within a JSON file. However, there were multiple reasons why this was ultimately changed to a database model. When using local storage, if a user where to access the website from a different device, all the data would not be shared between the two. Whilst it is only an MVP, this decision was overruled to go for a database model. With the introduction of a database model, meant that there needed to be an external server managing requests between the front-end and the database.  </p>

        <p>The choice of database used, was MongoDB. MongoDB was referred to as a nonrelational database, that is data is stored without the use of tabular schemas, and rows and columns. The huge upside of nonrelational databases, is their ease of use in the creation and destruction of data. MongoDB was selected as the database of choice in the MVP demo owing to its ease of use and integration with the server. Upon further examination and discussion, the use of a relational database structure is more suited to the types of data that is being stored in Tasker. That is:[Text Wrapping Break]A user has many workspaces/rooms. A workspace/room has many cards. A workspace/rooms can have many users.  </p>

        <p>Because of the relationship of data, it is more beneficial to go with a relational database, such as MySQL. Whilst there wasn't enough time to switch the database structure, this is something which needs to be investigated further for future development of the project.  </p>

        <p> Our choice of database leads into our choice of backend structure. As with most web applications in the modern day which are not tied into B2C software such as Commerce Cloud, we went with a node.js and express backend. Node and express allow us to use both user defined, and company designed modules in our project to speed up and aid development. One such module is: Mongoose. Mongoose allows us to interface with the database through JavaScript, instead of SQL. This also ties into our decision to go with GraphQL as our data query language. GraphQL is incredibly powerful and differs from the traditional REST based API that was popular in the past. GraphQL allows for us to only query for the data that we want, instead of having very specific endpoints for data, that will always respond with a set structure in a REST based API; GraphQL allows to dynamically query for only the data we need, and the response will always only be the data we need.  </p>

        <p>As such, the Ultimate pathway for a query of data front from our front-end works as follows: </p>
        
        <p>React Front-end GraphQL Query (front-end) --> Express, Mongoose and GraphQL (backend) --> MongoDB Atlas Database (Database) --> Express, Mongoose and GraphQL(backend) and ultimate back to the React front-end.</p>
        
        <p>There are also many other notable modules and libraries used to aid development. One such important module is bCrypt. bCrypt is what is used to encrypt any passwords that are used on the front-end and sent to the database. The database received an encrypted password, and as such on our Tasker Database, we never can view the password of any users. bCrypt uses an environment variable, set by us during deployment, as a seed for its encryption. The variable used is an extremely varied and random string, that is only able to be viewed on the deployment software used. This assures that the personal data (passwords) of our users is completely safe, and if our database is breached, the passwords of our users are not able to be used, as it requires both the secret encryption seed used, as well as the options JSON specified when using bCrypt to decrypt the passwords. Therefore, for a hacker to be successful in retrieving the password of users, both the database, the codebase as well as the deployment provider would need to all be simultaneously hacked to retrieve and decode the data: a very thorough and thick layer of security. </p> 

        <p>This Segway's into the deployment application used, it is a B2C software named Heroku. Heroku allows us to easily and effortless deploy a project which contains both a front-end which needs to compile and built (react) along with a server (node.js and express) in parallel, and throughout inputted config variables, allows the two to communicate with each other. In our project repository, is a file named: Procfile. This file is read by Heroku and specifies the server scripts that need to be run for the application to be deployed. The Procfile, essentially contains a ‘shortcut’ script which directs the command line to navigate to a specific directory, and execute a specific command, which is further specified within the package-json. There were a few issues during deployment which were eventually solved during debugging. The two standout issues were: not specifying the correct node.js version, and not instantiating an npm install. What the later statement translates to, is basically telling the command line to install all dependencies needed for the project to successfully build and ultimately deploy.</p>

        <p> With deployment, comes to state of the application as it stands. Our team is happy with the progress we have made towards development of Tasker and is close to becoming a minimum viable product. As it stands, the front-end is in a useable state, however there are some mobile usability issues, and front-end tweaks which would need to be made. As this is a relatively simple process, and the back end is of more consequence to the application working, the focus on development was here.  </p>

        <p> In relation the back end, login, signup and user authentication and session-based token storage works flawlessly, and additional features are in place such as, users being booted to the homepage should their authentication state not be in the required state for the page they are visiting. Within the login and signup, the front-end design for logging in with other organizations has been added, however the integration of these has not been completed and is a direction for future development.  </p>

        <p> Once authenticated, users can create a new workspace/room, and furthermore the goal was for users to be able to assign tasks to a specific room, however these are currently in a bare minimum state. The goal is to be able to both share workspace/rooms between users, and for a more varied tasks board to be used, very similar to a kanban board structure. In relation to the sharing of workspaces, between users, the back-end structure of this potential has been facilitated. Once a user navigates to a specific workspace/room, there is a query string with a unique identifier which corresponds to the specific workspace. As such, if multiple users to a single workspace was eventually facilitated in future development, then users would be able to simply share the URL with other users.  </p>

        <p> In relation to the features that the ultimate end goal product is to have, our team is happy with the outcome of the project given the time we had. Tasker is very close to being in an MVP state, and with a little bit more development time, Tasker would be ready to be presented to a board of potential investors, where our team would be able to discuss future directions of the project, and further development should funding allow </p>

        </p>

        <h3> Risks </h3>
        <p>
          The primary risks of our groups project are the languages and infrastructure we must use to create it. While we posses some knowledge of Java script and react and are utilizing that in our product’s early stages, as the project continues to grow, we must expand our range of technologies. Languages such as Swift or database technologies are unfamiliar to us and may not have the functionality that we require. They may also be difficult to learn or incorporate with other components of our project. Additionally, both Android and IOS platforms continue to update regularly, and an inexperienced development team may struggle to keep up with changes and multiple versions.
        </p>

        <h3> Group process and communications </h3>
        <p>
          Due to the COVID-19 restrictions and the fact that number of group members are studying online, the group communications will be conducted on-line using Microsoft Teams. Team chat will be used for communications between the video meetings. The group members involved in the software development will use Discord and GitHub for technical discussions about the project. While our meetings will be somewhat infrequent before closer to the deadline (no more than 2 a week), we will communicate far more frequently through text channels, staying up to date and sharing progress with each other. Unfortunately, we did experience a group member who failed to respond to communications. This was particularly frustrating as they were the initial creator of our group project idea. Since we had a large group the rest of the group just allocated amongst themselves the work the additional member would have done.

          <p>
            We conducted several meetings on MS teams, keeping notes of each as we progressed. These detail who the attendees were, what the aim of the meeting was and any decisions or allocations of work that were assigned. Smaller queries that did not require a full meeting were asked using the messaging feature of MS teams as well. For the writeup we created a document keeping track of each section and who was responsible for it.

          <h3> Comments  </h3>
          <p>
            <span>Ben:</span> We lost Ned at the beginning of this assignment, as he was the original member to have this idea this caused our group to flounder for direction somewhat, early on. However, we did originally have 7 members, so his absence wasn’t particularly significant on workload. A major obstacle/annoyance was attempting to have all group members attend group meetings. This is something I would like to be stricter on in future group work. I was pleasantly surprised by some members' desire to take on responsibility for a considerable workload and appreciated such. I have learnt to be more active in group discussions particularly when needing to establish a direction or goals for our group to focus on.   
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Daniel:</span> N/A 
            </p>
          <p>
            <span>Vladimir:</span> N/A
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Ayoj:</span> N/A
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Suvas:</span> Whilst everyone was at differing abilities throughout the assessment, our communication and acceptance of this fact was well received. We were able to come together and use our unique skills and abilities, to contribute to the assessment in a way that we could. One of the regrets that I personally have, which is a shared opinion between the group members, is our lack of Video meetings. Whilst we made the most of those meetings that we did conduct was insightful and used correctly. There were also many informal meetings between group members that were not recorded. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Group</span> Ned did not contribute to this group or assignment.  

            Something that worked well as a group was our ability to utilize the strengths of certain members, such as technical skills or aptitude for writing up our progress. This allowed us to work more efficiently than would otherwise have been possible, an efficiency that was required due to our delay in beginning. Part way through this assignment we also established better tools to allow us to manage the responsibility for certain tasks better and track individual contribution.  
            
             As a group we would have benefited from starting earlier to give ourselves more time and communicating better to avoid absentees during important group meetings.... 
            
            Something surprising was...  
            
            Because of the difficulties we faced as a group we have learnt the importance of avoiding them again. This means getting started earlier, maintaining higher standards for communication, and being more organized in who, how and when any sections of group work are getting done.
